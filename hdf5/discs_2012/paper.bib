	Abstract = {The hybrid MPI-OpenMP model is a natural parallel programming paradigm
	for emerging parallel architectures that are based on symmetric multiprocessor
	(SMP) clusters. This paper presents a hybrid implementation adapted
	for an implicit finite-element code developed for groundwater transport
	simulations. The original code was parallelized for distributed memory
	architecturesusing MPI (Message Passing Interface) using a domain
	decomposition strategy. OpenMP directives were then added to the
	code (a straightforward loop-level implementation) to use multiple
	threads within each MPI process. To improve the OpenMP performance,
	several loop modifications were adopted. The parallel performance
	results are compared for four modern parallel architectures. The
	results show that for most of the cases tested, the pure MPI approach
	outperforms the hybrid model. The exceptions to this observation
	were mainly due to a limitation in the MPI library implementation
	on one of the architectures. A general conclusion is that while the
	hybrid model is a promising approach for SMP cluster architectures,
	at the time of this writing, the payoff may not be justified for
	converting all existing MPI codes to hybrid codes. However, improvements
	in OpenMP compilers combined with potentialMPI limitations in SMP
	nodes may make the hybrid approach more attractive for a broader
	set of applications in the future.},

	Abstract = {Abstract 
The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the history of computing. 
Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore designs that preserves the programming 
paradigm of the past via binary compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom 
is now to double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation. 
 
A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years to discuss this 
change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach to parallel hardware and software 
may work from 2 or 8 processor systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 
and 32 processor systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level 
parallelism. },

	Abstract = {This paper presents a set of proposals for the OpenMP shared memory programming model oriented towards the denition of thread groups in the framework of nested parallelism. The paper also describes the additional functionalities required in the runtime library supporting the parallel execution. The extensions have been implemented in the OpenMP NanosCompiler and evaluated in a set of real applications and benchmarks. In this paper we present experimental results for one of these applications.},
	Address = {London, UK},
	Annote = {extended version of paper at http://www.ac.upc.es/nanos (couldn't find it)

*  simple and powerful programming models needed
*  many systems serialize nested constructs limiting performance returns expected with scaling
*  current models use MPI for coarse-grained parallelism, OpenMP or HPFortran for fine-grained
*  OpenMP extension to define user control over the work distribution in multilevel parallelism
