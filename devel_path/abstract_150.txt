Experiment management is a feedback loop cycling through planning, execution,
measurement, and analysis.  Experiment management in HPC follows this pattern
with three additional characteristics. One, HPC applications must deal with
frequent platform failures which can interrupt, perturb, or terminate
experiments. Two, these applications typically use MPI.  Three, a scheduling
system typically acts as a gate-keeper.  This paper introduces LEM, an
experimental management framework for HPC which simplifies all four phases of
experiment management. Planning is simplified by allowing the user to describe
their goals instead of constructing parameters for each task. To simplify
execution, LEM dispatches the tasks itself thereby freeing the user from
remembering the often arcane methods for interacting with various scheduling
systems. LEM provides transducers that automatically measure and record
important information; these can be extended to collect measurements specific
to each experiment.  Finally, analysis is simplified by providing a
visualization framework that allows interactive data exploration.
